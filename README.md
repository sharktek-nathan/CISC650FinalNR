# CISC650FinalNR
WireShark, TCPDump and various other networking tools generate files while an interface is capturing packets going over the network. This application serves as a web-based analyzer of these saved captures.

To see the output of a .pcap file, please upload *one* .pcap file (<55MBs) and click the "Process File" button.

This application was created by Nathan Rague for CISC 650 (Computer Networks) at NOVA SouthEastern University. If you are interested in seeing the source code, you can find it on GitHub.
